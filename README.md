# Mummy Maze with Search Algorithms
### Project Description
Mummy Maze with Search Algorithms is a Java-based project designed to solve various levels of the labyrinth game, Mummy Maze. The project implements and applies several search algorithms to navigate through the maze and find solutions. After solving a level, the project presents performance metrics of the selected search algorithm, allowing users to analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of different approaches.

### Installation
No special installation is required to run the project. Simply ensure that you have a Java development environment set up on your machine. The project was developed and tested using IntelliJ IDEA, but any Java-compatible IDE or command-line setup should work.

### Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 8 or higher installed.
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): (Optional) IntelliJ IDEA was used for development, but any Java-compatible IDE will suffice.
### Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Run the main class to start the application.
4. When prompted, select the search algorithm you wish to apply:
    - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    - Depth-First Search (DFS)
    - A*
    - Greedy Best-First Search
    - Others (as applicable)
5. After the algorithm completes, the program will display the solution path and performance metrics, such as:
    - Execution time
    - Number of nodes explored
    - Memory usage
    - Path length
### Features
- Multiple Search Algorithms: Compare and contrast different search algorithms to solve the Mummy Maze levels.
- Performance Metrics: Get detailed insights into the efficiency of each algorithm.
- Simple Interface: Easy selection of algorithms with automatic performance reporting.
